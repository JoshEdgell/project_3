Group Standard Practices
*NEVER WORK ON DEV BRANCH*
*NEVER, EVER PUSH TO MASTER*
Pull from dev or merge to dev (on github), but never work on dev

**NEVER PUSH YOUR OWN STUFF TO DEV**
**REVIEW OTHERS' WORK BEFORE STARTING SOMETHING NEW**

PULLING FROM GIT
1. git pull origin dev (don't forget npm install, too)
2. make new branch, work on branch, make sure it works
3. git push origin newbranch
4. partner reviews changes
5. partner merges to dev
